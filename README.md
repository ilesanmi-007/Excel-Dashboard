# **Insights**
* There's a good yearly increase
* In the 4th quarter of every year, we experience the most sales and this is due to the reduction in price.
* While for the first quarter, we experience fewer sales due to an increase in price (The first quarter has the highest Price every year in the past 4 years)
* The state with the most sales is Califonia
* The City with the most sales in New York City
 > New York City, New York has the highest number of sales generally. However, the number of Cities which California has, makes it have a high total sales compared to New York

Thanks for your time.
